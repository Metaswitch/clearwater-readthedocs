# Migrating to Automatic Clustering and Configuration Sharing

Clearwater now supports an [automatic clustering and configuration sharing](Automatic_Clustering_Config_Sharing) feature. This makes Clearwater deployments much easier to manage. However deployments created before the **TODO** release do not use this feature. This article explains how to migrate a deployment to take advantage of the new feature.

## Upgrade the Deployment

[Upgrade](Upgrading_a_Clearwater_deployment) to the latest stable Clearwater release.

## Verify Configuration Files

Do the following on each node in turn:

1.  Run `/usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/migration-utils/configlint.py`. This examines the existing `/etc/clearwater/config` file and checks that the migration scripts can handle all the settings defined in it.

2.  If `configlint.py` produces a warning about a config option, this can mean one of two things:
    * The config option is invalid (for example, because there is a typo, or this option has been retired). Check the [configuration options reference](Clearwater_Configuration_Options_Reference.md) for a list of valid options.
    * The config option is valid, but the migration script doesn't recognise the option and won't automatically migrate it. In this case, you will need to make a note of this config option now, and add it back in after the rest of the migration has run. (A later step in this process covers that.)

Once you have checked your configuration file and taken a note of any unrecognised settings, continue with the next step.

## Prepare Local Configuration Files

Do the following on each node in turn:

1.  Run `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/migration-utils/migrate_local_config /etc/clearwater/config`. This examines the existing `/etc/clearwater/config` file and produces a new `/etc/clearwater/local_config` which contains the settings only relevant to this node. Check that this file looks sensible.

2.  Edit `/etc/clearwater/local_config` to add a line `etcd_cluster="<NodeIPs>"` where `NodeIPs` is a comma separated list of the private IP addresses of nodes in the deployment. For example if your deployment contained nodes with IP addresses of 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.6, `NodeIPs` would be `10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2,10.0.0.3,10.0.0.4,10.0.0.5,10.0.0.6`

3.  If the node is a Sprout or Ralf node, run `/usr/share/clearwater/bin/chronos_configuration_split.py`. This examines the existing `/etc/chronos/chronos.conf` file and extracts the clustering settings into a new file called `/etc/chronos/chronos_cluster.conf`. Check each of these files by hand to make sure they look sensible.

4.  Run `sudo touch /etc/clearwater/no_cluster_manager`. This temporarily disables the cluster manager so that you can program it with the current deployment topology.

## Prepare Shared Configuration Files

This step merges the config from all the nodes in your deployment into a single config file that will be managed by etcd.

1.  Log onto to one of the nodes in the deployment and create a temporary directory (e.g. `~/config-migration`). Copy the `/etc/clearwater/config` file from each node in the deployment to this directory. Give each of these a name of the form `<node>_orig_config`, e.g. `sprout-1_orig_config`.

2.  Run `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/migration-utils/migrate_shared_config`, passing it all the config files in the temporary directory

    * `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/migration-utils/migrate_shared_config *_orig_config`

3.  This will produce the file `/etc/clearwater/shared_config`. Check the contents of this file looks sensible. If running `configlint.py` indicated that any configuration would not be automatically migrated, add that configuration to `/etc/clearwater/shared_config` now.

4.  Copy this file to `/etc/clearwater/shared_config` on each node in the deployment.

5.  On each node in turn:

    * Run `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/infrastructure/migration-utils/switch_to_migrated_config`
    * Run `sudo service clearwater-infrastructure restart` to regenerate any dependant configuration files
    * Restart the Clearwater services on the node.

## Install Clustering and Configuration Management Services

On each node run `sudo apt-get install clearwater-cluster-manager clearwater-config-manager`.

## Upload the Current Cluster Settings

Now you need to tell the cluster manager about the current topology of the various database clusters that exist in a Clearwater deployment. For each of the nodes types listed below, log onto *one* of the nodes of that type and run the specified commands.

### Sprout

    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_memcached_cluster sprout
    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_chronos_cluster sprout

### Ralf

    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_memcached_cluster ralf
    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_chronos_cluster ralf

### Homestead

    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_cassandra_cluster homestead

### Homer

    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_cassandra_cluster homer

### Memento

    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_memcached_cluster memento
    /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/load_from_cassandra_cluster memento

## Upload the Shared Configuration

Run the following commands on *one* of your Sprout nodes. This will upload the configuration that is shared across the deployment to etcd. If you add any new nodes to the deployment they will automatically learn this configuration from etcd.

* `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/upload_shared_config`
* `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/upload_scscf_json`
* `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/upload_bgcf_json`
* `sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/upload_enum_json`

## Tidy Up

The final step is to re-enable the cluster manager by running the following commands:

    sudo rm /etc/clearwater/no_cluster_manager
