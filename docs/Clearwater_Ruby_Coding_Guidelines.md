# Ruby Coding Guidelines

Strongly based on https://github.com/chneukirchen/styleguide/ with some local changes.

## Formatting:

*     Use UTF-8 encoding in your source files.
*     Use 2 space indent, no tabs.
*     Use Unix-style line endings, including on the last line of the file.
*     Use spaces around operators, after commas, colons and semicolons, around { and before }.
*     No spaces after (, [ and before ], ).
*     Prefer postfix modifiers (if, unless, rescue) when possible.
*     Indent when as deep as case then indent the contents one step more.
*     Use an empty line before the return value of a method (unless it only has one line), and an empty line between defs.
*     Use Yard and its conventions for API documentation.  Don't put an empty line between the comment block and the definition.
*     Use empty lines to break up a long method into logical paragraphs.
*     Keep lines shorter than 80 characters.
*     Avoid trailing whitespace.

## Syntax:

*     Use def with parentheses when there are arguments. 
*         Conversely, avoid parentheses when there are none.
*     Never use for, unless you exactly know why.  Prefer each or loop.
*     Never use then, a newline is sufficient.
*     Prefer words to symbols. 
  *         and and or in place of && and ||
  *         not in place of !
*     Avoid ?:, use if (remember: if returns a value, use it).
*     Avoid if not, use unless.
*     Suppress superfluous parentheses when calling methods, unless the method has side-effects.
*     Prefer do...end over {...} for multi-line blocks.
*     Prefer {...} over do...end for single-line blocks.
*     Avoid chaining function calls over multiple lines (implying, use {...} for chained functions.
*     Avoid return where not required.
*     Avoid line continuation (\\) where not required.
*     Using the return value of = is okay.
*     if v = array.grep(/foo/)
*     Use ||= freely for memoization.
*     When using regexps, freely use =~, -9, $~, $\ and $` when needed.
*     Prefer symbols (:name) to strings where applicable.

## Naming:

*     Use snake_case for methods.
*     Use CamelCase for classes and modules.  (Keep acronyms like HTTP, RFC and XML uppercase.)
*     Use SCREAMING_CASE for other constants.
*     Use one-letter variables for short block/method parameters, according to this scheme:
  *     a,b,c: any object
  *     d: directory names
  *     e: elements of an Enumerable or a rescued Exception
  *     f: files and file names
  *     i,j: indexes or integers
  *     k: the key part of a hash entry
  *     m: methods
  *     o: any object
  *     r: return values of short methods
  *     s: strings
  *     v: any value
  *     v: the value part of a hash entry
  *     And in general, the first letter of the class name if all objects are of that type (e.g. `nodes.each { |n| n.name }`)
*     Use _ for unused variables.
*     When defining binary operators, name the argument other.
*     Use def self.method to define singleton methods.

## Comments:

*     Comments longer than a word are capitalized and use punctuation.  Use two spaces after periods.
*     Avoid superfluous comments.  It should be easy to write self-documenting code.

## Code design

*     Avoid needless meta-programming.
*     Avoid long methods.  Much prefer to go too far the wrong way and have multiple one-line methods.
*     Avoid long parameter lists, consider using a hash with documented defaults instead.
*     Prefer functional methods over procedural ones (common methods below): 
  *         each - Apply block to each element
  *         map - Apply block to each element and remember the returned values.
  *         select - Find all matching elements
  *         detect - Find first matching element
  *         inject - Equivalent to foldl from Haskell
*     Use the mutating version of functional methods (e.g. map!) where applicable, rather than using temporary variables.
*     Avoid non-obvious function overloading (e.g. don't use ["0"] * 8 to initialize an array).
*     Prefer objects to vanilla arrays/hashes, this allows you to document the structure and interface. 
  *         Protect the internal data stores from external access.  Write API functions explicitly.
  *         Use attr_accessor to create getters/setters for simple access.
*         Prefer to add a to_s function to an object for ease of debugging.
*     Internally, use standard libraries where applicable (See the docs for the various APIs).: 
  *         Hash, Array and Set
  *         String
  *         Fixnum and Integer
  *         Thread and Mutex
  *         Fiber
  *         Complex
  *         Float
  *         Dir and File
  *         Random
  *         Time
*     Prefer string interpolation "blah#{expr}" rather than appending to strings.
*     Prefer using the %w{} family of array generators to typing out arrays of strings manually.

## General:

*     Write ruby -w safe code.
*     Avoid alias, use alias_method if you absolutely must alias something (for Monkey Patching).
*     Use OptionParser for parsing command line options.
*     Target Ruby 2.0 (except where libraries are not compatible, such as Chef).
*     Do not mutate arguments unless that is the purpose of the method.
*     Do not mess around in core classes when writing libraries.
*     Do not program defensively.
*     Keep the code simple.
*     Be consistent.
*     Use common sense.
