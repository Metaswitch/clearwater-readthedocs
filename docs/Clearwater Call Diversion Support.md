Call Diversion
==============

Clearwater allows users to define rules for handling of incoming
calls, by implementing a superset of the IR.92 version of call
diversion (which is itself a cut-down version of the MMTEL call
diversion service).

The relevant specifications are

-   [3GPP TS 24.604](http://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi\_ts/124600\_124699/124604/11.04.00\_60/ts\_124604v110400p.pdf)
    - the full specification
-   [GSMA PRD IR.92](http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IR.92-v7.0.pdf), section 2.3.8
    - the required subset.

We have implemented all of IR.92 section 2.3.8. We have implemented all
of 3GPP TS 24.604 with the following exceptions.

-   CDIV Notification (notifying the diverting party when a call has
    been diverted) is not supported
-   We only support the default subscription options from table 4.3.1.1
    (most notably, no privacy options).
-   We only support hard-coded values for network provider options from
    table 4.3.1.2, as follows.
    -   We stop ringing the diverting party before/simultaneously with
        trying the diverted-to target (rather than waiting for them to
        start ringing).
        -   Served user communication retention on invocation of
            diversion (forwarding or deflection) = Clear communication
            to the served user on invocation of call diversion
        -   Served user communication retention when diverting is
            rejected at diverted-to user = No action at the diverting
            user

    -   We don't support CDIV Notification (as above).
        -   Subscription option is provided for "served user received
            reminder indication on outgoing communication that CDIV is
            currently activated" = No
        -   CDIV Indication Timer = irrelevant
        -   CDIVN Buffer Timer = irrelevant

    -   We support up to 5 diversions and then reject the call.
        -   Total number of call diversions for each communication = 5
        -   AS behavior when the maximum number of diversions for a
            communicaton is reached = Reject the communication

    -   The default no-reply timer before Communication Forwarding on no
        Reply occurs is hard-coded to 20s. This is still overridable on
        a per-subscriber basis.
        -   Communication forwarding on no reply timer = 36s

-   Obviously, the interactions with services that we haven't
    implemented yet have not been implemented! In particular, we haven't
    implemented any interactions with terminating privacy.
-   We've ignored the comment in section 4.2.1.1 which
    says "It should be possible that a user has the option to restrict
    receiving communications that are forwarded" but doesn't provide any
    function for this.

Note that we *have* implemented support for Communication Deflection (in
which the callee sends a 302 response and this triggers forwarding)
despite it not being required by IR.92.
