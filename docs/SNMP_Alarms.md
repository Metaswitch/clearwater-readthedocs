# SNMP Alarms

Clearwater nodes report errors over the SNMP interface when they are in an abnormal
state, and clear them when they return to normal. They only report errors relating to
that node - not errors relating to the whole deployment, which is the role of an external
monitoring service.

Error indications come in two forms:

*   For clearly-defined errors not based on thresholds, the Clearwater node sets an
    ITU Alarm MIB from [RFC 3877](http://tools.ietf.org/html/3877) and sends an SNMP
    notification to a configured external SNMP manager.

*   For errors based on a threshold set on a statistic (such as latency targets or
    number of failed connections), the Clearwater node [exposes that statistic over
    SNMP](Clearwater_SNMP_Statistics.md). A downstream statistics aggregator from the Management and
    Orchestration (MANO) layer monitors these statistics, compares them to its
    configured thresholds, and raises alarms on that basis.

## EMS

To integrate with an EMS, the EMS must support the following capabilities of RFC 3877 to
obtain the brief description, detailed description, and severity for the alarm:

*   The EMS must be configured to catch the SNMP INFORM messages used to
    report alarms from Clearwater. It is also recommended that the EMS must
    display the alarm information provided by the following MIBs.

*   Upon receiving a SNMP INFORM message from Clearwater the EMS can obtain the
    alarm data by the following:

    *   The EMS must retrieve the AlarmModelEntry MIB table data associated
        with the current SNMP INFORM message from Clearwater. This MIB provides the
        active/clear state, alarm description, and a table index for the ituAlarmEntry
        MIB.

    *   The EMS must the retrieve the ituAlarmEntry MIB table data associated
        with the current alarm from Clearwater. This MIB provides the alarm
        severity and the additional detailed alarm description.

## Alarm Models

The alarm models used by Clearwater are defined in [alarmdefinition.h](https://github.com/Metaswitch/cpp-common/blob/master/include/alarmdefinition.h).

## Alarm Resiliency

Alarms are reported in such a way that if a component receiving alarm
notifications were to fail, when it recovers it would regain knowledge of the 
current alarm state of the system. This is partly because Clearwater nodes 
keep track of the errors they have reported and re-report these every thirty 
seconds. Clearwater also has a synchronise alarms function which can be called
if your external monitoring service fails, this will resend the current error
state of the system to the monitoring service.
