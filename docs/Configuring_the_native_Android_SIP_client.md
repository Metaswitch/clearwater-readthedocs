# Using the Android SIP Client with Clearwater

These instructions detail how to enable the stock Android SIP client.
The instructions vary depending on your handset and Android model, in
particular the Nexus 6 running 5.1.1 has different menus to the other
known [supported
devices](Configuring_the_native_Android_SIP_client.md#known-supported-devices)
listed. If you get them working on another device, please add to the list.
Equally, if they do not work, please add your device to the unsupported
list.

### Instructions

1.  Ensure that you have a data connection (either through 3G or WiFi).
2.  Launch your standard dialer (often called Phone or Dialer).
3.  Bring up the menu. Depending on your phone, this may be via a
    physical Menu button, or via an icon (consisting of three dots in a vertical line 
    in either the top right or bottom right).
4.  From the menu, navigate to the internet calling accounts menu.
    - On many devices this is located in **Settings** (or **Call Settings**) >
      **Internet Call Settings** > **Accounts**.
    - On the Nexus 6 running 5.1.1 this is located in **Settings** > **Calls** >
      **Calling accounts** > **Internet Call Settings** > **Internet calling
      (SIP) accounts**.
5.  Press **Add account** and enter its configuration.
    -   Set **Username**, **Password** and **Server** to their usual
        values.
    -   Open the **Optional settings** panel to see and set the
        following options.
    -   Set **Transport type** to TCP.
    -   Set **Authentication username** to
        "sip:*&lt;username\>*@*&lt;server\>*", substituting (note: once we
        switch to storing user digest by private id, this will change)
    -   Some SIP clients do not have an **Authentication username** field. To
        make calls through Clearwater using these clients you will have to
        configure an external HSS to [allow one subscriber to have two private
        identities](External_HSS_Integration.md#allowing-one-subscriber-to-have-two-private-identities).
        This will allow the subscriber to have one private identity of the form
        **`1234@example.com`** (the IMS standard form), and one private identity
        **`1234`** (which the phone will default to in the absence of a
        Authentication username).
6.  Once done, choose **Save**.
7.  Enable making internet calls.
    - On many devices this is located in the **Call** menu (which can be
      accessed from the dialler by selecting **Settings** as above). Once here
      under **Internet Call Settings** select **Use Internet Calling** and set
      this to **Ask for each call**.
    - On a Nexus 6 running 5.1.1  this is located in the **Calling accounts** menu. From
      here select **Use internet calling** and set this to **Only for Internet
      Calls**.
8.  Enable receiving internet calls (note this significantly reduces your
    battery life).
    - On many devices this is located in **Settings** > **Internet Call
      Settings** > **Accounts** once here select **Receive Incoming Calls**.
    - On the Nexus 6 running 5.1.1 this is located in **Settings** > **Calls** >
      **Calling accounts** once here select **Receive Incoming Calls**.

#### Adding a SIP contact to your phone book

- For many devices:
    -  navigate to the **People** App. Select **+** in the top right to
    add a new contact to the phone book.
    -  Under **Add more information** select **Add another field**.
    In this menu choose **Internet call** and enter your contact's
    SIP address.
- For the Nexus 6 running 5.1.1:
    - navigate to the **Contacts** App. Select **+** in the bottom right to add
      a new contact to the phone book.
    - Under the **Sip** field enter your contact's SIP address.
    

##### Making a call

-   Make a call from the standard dialler to another Clearwater line,
    e.g. 6505551234 and hit the Call button.

    internet calling and your call should connect.
