# Multiple Domains

A single Clearwater deployment can support subscribers in multiple domains.  This document

*   gives some background context
*   describes how to configure multiple domains
*   covers some restrictions on this support.

## Background

Clearwater acts as an S-CSCF for one or more home domains.  It can only provide service to users within a home domain for which it is the S-CSCF.  Traffic to or from users in any other home domains must go via the S-CSCF for those other domains.

Home domains are a routing concept.  There is a similar (but distinct) concept of authentication realms.  When a user authenticates, as well as providing their username and digest, they must also provide a realm, which describes which user database to authenticate against.  Many clients default their home domain to match their authentication realm.

A single Clearwater deployment can support multiple home domains and multiple realms.

## Configuration

There are three steps to configuring multiple home domains and/or multiple realms.

*   Configure the Clearwater deployment to know about all the home domains it is responsible for.
*   Add DNS records to point all home domains at the deployment.
*   Create subscribers within these multiple home domains, and optionally using multiple different realms.

### Configuring the Clearwater Deployment

The `/etc/clearwater/config` file can contain two properties that are relevant to this function.

*   `home_domain` - defines the "default" home domain and must always be set
*   `additional_home_domains` - optionally defines additional home domains

The only difference between the default home domain and the additional home domains is that the default home domain is used whenever Clearwater must guess the home domain for a TEL URI, e.g. when filling in the orig-ioi or term-ioi parameters on the P-Charging-Vector header.  This is fairly minor, and generally you can consider the default home domain and additional home domains as equivalent.

### Adding DNS Records

The [Clearwater DNS Usage](Clearwater_DNS_Usage) document describes how to configure DNS for a simple single-domain deployment.  This includes creating NAPTR, SRV and A records that resolve the home domain (or `<zone>`) to the bono nodes.  If you have additional home domains, you should repeat this for each additional home domain.  This ensures that SIP clients can find the bono nodes without needing to be explicitly configured with a proxy.

### Creating subscribers.

Once the deployment has multiple domain support enabled, you can create subscribers in any of the domains, and with any realm.

*   If you use ellis, the [`create-numbers.py`](https://github.com/Metaswitch/ellis/blob/dev/docs/create-numbers.md) script accepts a `--realm` parameter to specify the realm in which the directory numbers are created.  When a number is allocated in the ellis UI, ellis picks any valid number/realm combination.

*   If you [bulk-provision](https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/blob/dev/docs/Bulk-Provisioning%20Numbers.md) numbers, the home domain and realm can be specified in the input CSV file.

*   If you use homestead's [provisioning API](https://github.com/Metaswitch/crest/blob/dev/docs/homestead_api.md) (i.e. without an external HSS), you can specify the home domain and realm as parameters.

Alternatively, you can use an external HSS, and configure the subscribers using its provisioning interface. 

## Restriction

Clearwater does not support connections to multiple Diameter realms for the Cx interface to the HSS or the Rf interface to the CDF - only a single Diameter realm is supported.
