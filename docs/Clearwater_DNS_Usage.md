# Clearwater DNS Usage

DNS is the [Domain Name System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS).  It maps service names to hostnames and then hostnames to IP addresses.  Clearwater uses DNS.

This document describes

*   Clearwater's DNS strategy and requirements
*   how to configure [AWS Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) and [BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) to meet these.

DNS is also used as part of the [ENUM](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6116.txt) system for mapping E.164 numbers to SIP URIs.  This isn't discussed in this document - instead see the separate [ENUM](enum.md) document.

*If you are installing an All-in-One Clearwater node, you do not need any DNS records and can ignore the rest of this page.*

## Strategy

Clearwater makes heavy use of DNS to refer to its nodes.  It uses it for

*   identifying individual nodes, e.g. sprout-1.example.com might resolve the IP address of the first sprout node
*   identifying the nodes within a cluster, e.g. sprout.example.com resolves to all the IP addresses in the cluster
*   fault-tolerance
*   selecting the nearest site in a multi-site deployments, using latency-based routing.

Clearwater also supports using DNS for identifying non-Clearwater nodes.  In particular, it supports DNS for identifying SIP peers using NAPTR and SRV records, as described in [RFC 3263](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3263.txt).

## Resiliency

By default, Clearwater routes all DNS requests through an instance of [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq)
running on localhost. This round-robins requests between the servers in /etc/resolv.conf,
as described in [its FAQ](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/docs/FAQ):

> By default, dnsmasq treats all the nameservers it knows about as
> equal: it picks the one to use using an algorithm designed to avoid 
> nameservers which aren't responding.

If the `signaling_dns_server` option is set in `/etc/clearwater/config` (which is mandatory when using
[traffic separation](Multiple_Network_Support.md)), Clearwater will not use dnsmasq. Instead, resiliency
is achieved by being able to specify up to three servers in a comma-separated list (e.g.
`signaling_dns_server=1.2.3.4,10.0.0.1,192.168.1.1`), and Clearwater will fail over between them as follows:

* It will always query the first server in the list first
* If this returns SERVFAIL or times out (which happens after a randomised 500ms-1000ms period), it will resend the query to the second server
* If this returns SERVFAIL or times out, it will resend the query to the third server
* If all servers return SERVFAIL or time out, the DNS query will fail

Clearwater caches DNS responses for several minutes (to reduce the load on DNS servers, and the latency introduced by querying them). If a cache entry is stale,
but the DNS servers return SERVFAIL or time out when Clearwater attempts to refresh it, Clearwater will continue to use the cached value until the DNS servers
become responsive again. This minimises the impact of a DNS server failure on calls.

## Requirements

### DNS Server

Clearwater requires the DNS server to support

*   [RFC 1034](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) and [RFC 1035](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) - basic DNS
*   [RFC 2181](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2181.txt) - clarifications to DNS
*   [RFC 2782](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2782.txt) - SRV records
*   [RFC 3596](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3596.txt) - AAAA records (if IPv6 is required).

Support for latency-based routing and health-checking are required for multi-site deployments.

Support for [RFC 2915](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2915.txt) (NAPTR records) is also suggested, but not required.  NAPTR records specify the transport (UDP, TCP, etc.) to use for a particular service - without it, UEs will default (probably to UDP).

AWS Route 53 supports all these features except NAPTR.  BIND supports all these features except latency-based routing (although there is a [patch](http://www.caraytech.com/geodns/) for this) and health-checking.

### DNS Records

Clearwater requires the following DNS records to be configured.

*   bono
    *   `bono-1.<zone>`, `bono-2.<zone>`... (A and/or AAAA) - per-node records for bono
    *   `<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - cluster record for bono, resolving to all bono nodes - used by UEs that don't support RFC 3263 (NAPTR/SRV)
    *   `<zone>` (NAPTR, optional) - specifies transport requirements for accessing bono - service `SIP+D2T` maps to `_sip._tcp.<zone>` and `SIP+D2U` maps to `_sip._udp.<zone>`
    *   `_sip._tcp.<zone>` and `_sip._udp.<zone>` (SRV) - cluster SRV records for bono, resolving to port 5060 on each of the per-node records
*   sprout
    *   `sprout-1.<zone>`, `sprout-2.<zone>`... (A and/or AAAA) - per-node records for sprout
    *   `sprout.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - cluster record for sprout, resolving to all sprout nodes - used by P-CSCFs that don't support RFC 3263 (NAPTR/SRV)
    *   `sprout.<zone>` (NAPTR, optional) - specifies transport requirements for accessing sprout - service `SIP+D2T` maps to `_sip._tcp.sprout.<zone>`
    *   `_sip._tcp.sprout.<zone>` (SRV) - cluster SRV record for sprout, resolving to port 5054 on each of the per-node records
    *   `icscf.sprout.<zone>` (NAPTR, only required if using sprout as an I-CSCF) - specifies transport requirements for accessing sprout - service `SIP+D2T` maps to `_sip._tcp.icscf.sprout.<zone>`
    *   `_sip._tcp.icscf.sprout.<zone>` (SRV, only required if using sprout as an I-CSCF) - cluster SRV record for sprout, resolving to port 5052 on each of the per-node records
*   homestead
    *   `homestead-1.<zone>`, `homestead-2.<zone>`... (A and/or AAAA) - per-node records for homestead
    *   `hs.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - cluster record for homestead, resolving to all homestead nodes
*   homer
    *   `homer-1.<zone>`, `homer-2.<zone>`... (A and/or AAAA) - per-node records for homer
    *   `homer.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - cluster record for homer, resolving to all homer nodes
*   ralf
	*   `ralf-1.<zone>`, `ralf-2.<zone>`... (A and/or AAAA) - per-node records for ralf
	*   `ralf.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - cluster record for ralf, resolving to all ralf nodes
*   ellis
    *   `ellis-1.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - per-node record for ellis
    *   `ellis.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - "cluster"/access record for ellis
*   standalone application server (e.g. gemini/memento)
    *   `<standalone name>-1.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - per-node record for each standalone application server
    *   `<standalone name>.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA) - "cluster"/access record for the standalone application servers

Of these, the following must be resolvable by UEs - the others need only be resolvable within the core of the network.  If you have a NAT-ed network, the following must resolve to public IP addresses, while the others should resolve to private IP addresses.

*   bono
    *   `<zone>` (A and/or AAAA)
    *   `<zone>` (NAPTR, optional)
    *   `_sip._tcp.<zone>` and `_sip._udp.<zone>` (SRV)
*   ellis
    *   `ellis.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA)
*   memento
    *   `memento.<zone>` (A and/or AAAA)


If you are not deploying with some of these components, you do not need the DNS records to be configured for them.  For example, if you are using a different P-CSCF (and so don't need bono), you don't need the bono DNS records.  Likewise, if you are deploying with an external HSS (and so don't need ellis), you don't need the ellis DNS records.

## Configuration

Clearwater can work with any DNS server that meets the [requirements above](#dns-server).  However, most of our testing has been performed with

*   [AWS Route 53](http://aws.amazon.com/route53/) - see [configuration instructions](#aws-route-53)
*   [BIND](https://www.isc.org/downloads/bind/) - see [configuration instructions](#bind).

The Clearwater nodes also need to know the identity of their DNS server.  Ideally, this is done via [DHCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP) within your virtualization infrastructure.  Alternatively, you can [configure it manually](#client-configuration).

The UEs need to know the identity of the DNS server too.  In a testing environment, you may be able to use DHCP or manual configuration.  In a public network, you will need to register the `<zone>` domain name you are using and arranging for an NS record for `<zone>` to point to your DNS server.

### AWS Route 53

Clearwater's [automated install](Automated_Install.md) automatically configures AWS Route 53.  There is no need to follow the following instructions if you are using the automated install.

The official [AWS Route 53 documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html) is a good reference, and most of the following steps are links into it.

To use AWS Route 53 for Clearwater, you need to

*   [create a domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/CreatingNewDNS.html)
*   [create record sets](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/RRSchanges_console.html) for each of the non-geographically-redundant [records Clearwater requires](#dns-records).

For the geographically-redundant records, you need to

*   [create a health-check](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/health-checks-creating-deleting.html) for each of your sites
*   [create latency-based-routing records](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/HowToLatencyRRS.html) for each of your sites
*   associate each site's records with its health-check.

Note that AWS Route 53 does not support NAPTR records.

### BIND

To use BIND, you need to

*   install it
*   create an entry for your "zone" (DNS suffix your deployment uses)
*   configure the zone with a "zone file"
*   restart BIND.

Note that BIND does not support latency-based routing or health-checking.

#### Installation

To install BIND on Ubuntu, issue `sudo apt-get install bind9`.

#### Creating Zone Entry

To create an entry for your zone, edit the `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` file to add a line of the following form, replacing `<zone>` with your zone name.

    zone "<zone>" IN { type master; file "/etc/bind/db.<zone>"; };

#### Configuring Zone

Zones are configured through "zone files" (defined in [RFC 1034](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1034.txt) and [RFC 1035](http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt)).

If you followed the instructions above, the zone file for your zone is at `/etc/bind/db.<zone>`.

For Clearwater, you should be able to adapt the following example zone file by correcting the IP addresses and duplicating (or removing) entries where you have more (or fewer) than 2 nodes in each tier.

#### Restarting

To restart BIND, issue `sudo service bind9 restart`.  Check /var/log/syslog for any error messages.

### Client Configuration

Clearwater nodes need to know the identity of their DNS server.  Ideally, this is achieved through DHCP.  There are two main situations in which it might need to be configured manually.

*   When DNS configuration is not provided via DHCP.
*   When incorrect DNS configuration is provided via DHCP.

Either way, you must

*   create an `/etc/dnsmasq.resolv.conf` file containing the desired DNS configuration (probably just the single line `nameserver <IP address>`)
*   add `RESOLV_CONF=/etc/dnsmasq.resolv.conf` to `/etc/default/dnsmasq`
*   run `service dnsmasq restart`.

(As background, [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is a DNS forwarder that runs on each Clearwater node to act as a cache.  Local processes look in `/etc/resolv.conf` for DNS configuration, and this points them to localhost, where dnsmasq runs.  In turn, dnsmasq takes its configuration from `/etc/dnsmasq.resolv.conf`.  By default, dnsmasq would use `/var/run/dnsmasq/resolv.conf`, but this is controlled by DHCP.)

### IPv6 AAAA DNS lookups

Clearwater can be installed on an IPv4-only system, an IPv6-only system, or a system with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses (though the Clearwater software does not use both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same time).

Normally, systems with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will prefer IPv6, performing AAAA lookups first and only trying an A record lookup if that fails. This may cause problems (or be inefficient) if you know that all your Clearwater DNS records are A records.

In this case, you can configure a preference for A lookups by editing `/etc/gai.conf` and commenting out the line `precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100` (as described at http://askubuntu.com/questions/32298/prefer-a-ipv4-dns-lookups-before-aaaaipv6-lookups).
