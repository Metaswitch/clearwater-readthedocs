Multiple Network Support
========================

Introduction
------------

As of the Ultima release, Project Clearwater can be configured to
provide signaling service (SIP/HTTP/Diameter) on a separate physical (or
virtual) network to management services (SNMP/SSH/Provisioning). This
may be used to protect management devices (on a firewalled network) from
attack from the outside world (on the signaling network).

Technical Details
-----------------

Network Independence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If traffic separation is configured, the management and signaling
networks are accessed by the VM via completely separate (virtual)
network interfaces.

The management and signaling networks may be completely independent.

-  There need not be any way to route between them.
-  The IP addresses, subnets and default gateways used on the networks
   may be the same, may overlap or may be completely distinct.

Traffic Distinction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following traffic is carried over the management interface:

-  SSH
-  DNS (for management traffic)
-  SNMP statistics
-  SAS
-  NTP
-  Homestead provisioning
-  Homer provisioning
-  Ellis provisioning API
-  M/Monit

The following traffic is carried over the signaling interface:

-  DNS (for signaling traffic)
-  ENUM
-  SIP between the UE, Bono and Sprout
-  Cx between Homestead and the HSS
-  Rf between Ralf and the CDF
-  Ut between Homer and the UE
-  inter-tier HTTP
-  intra-tier memcached, Cassandra and Chronos flows

Both interfaces respond to ICMP pings which can be used by external
systems to perform health-checking if desired.

Configuration
-------------

Pre-requisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The (possibly virtual) machines that are running your Project Clearwater
services will need to be set up with a second network interface
(referred to as ``eth1`` in the following).

You will need to determine the IP configuration for your second network,
including IP address, subnet, default gateway, DNS server. DHCP is
supported on this interface if required but you should ensure that the
DHCP lease time is sufficiently high to ensure that the local IP address
does not change regularly.

Preparing the network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to the varied complexities of IP networking, it would be impractical
to attempt to automate configuring the Linux-level view of the various
networks. Network namespaces are created and managed using the
``ip netns`` tool, which is a standard part of Ubuntu 14.04.

The following example commands (when run as root) create a network
namespace, move ``eth1`` into it, configure a static IP address and
configure routing.

::

    ip netns add signaling
    ip link set eth1 netns signaling
    ip netns exec signaling ifconfig lo up
    ip netns exec signaling ifconfig eth1 1.2.3.4/16 up
    ip netns exec signaling route add default gateway 1.2.0.1 dev eth1

Obviously you should make any appropriate changes to the above to
correctly configure your chosen signaling network. These changes are
**not** persisted across reboots on Linux and you should ensure that
these are run on boot before the ``clearwater-infrastructure`` service
is run. A sensible place to configure this would be in
``/etc/rc.local``.

Finally, you should create ``/etc/netns/signaling/resolv.conf``
configuring the DNS server you'd like to use on the signaling network.
The format of this file is documented at
http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man5/resolv.conf.5.html but a
simple example file might just contain the following.

::

    nameserver <DNS IP address>

Project Clearwater Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that the signaling namespace is configured and has networking set
up, it's time to apply it to Project Clearwater. To do this, change the
``local_ip``, ``public_ip`` and ``public_hostname`` lines in
``/etc/clearwater/local_config`` to refer to the node's identities in
the signaling network and add the following lines:

::

    signaling_namespace=<namespace name>
    signaling_dns_server=<DNS IP address>
    management_local_ip=<Node's local IP address in the management

If you've not yet installed the Project Clearwater services, do so now
and the namespaces will be automatically used.

If you've already installed the Project Clearwater services, run
``sudo service clearwater-infrastructure restart`` and restart all the
Clearwater-related services running on each machine (you can see what
these are with ``sudo monit summary``).

Diagnostic Changes
------------------

All the built-in Clearwater diagnostics will automatically take note of
network namespaces, but if you are running diagnostics yourself (e.g.
following instructions from the `troubleshooting
page <Troubleshooting_and_Recovery.html>`__) you may need to prefix your
commands with ``ip netns exec <namespace>`` to run them in the signaling
namespace. The following tools will need this prefix:

-  ``cqlsh`` - For viewing Cassandra databases
-  ``nodetool`` - For viewing Cassandra status
-  ``telnet`` - For inspecting Memcached stores
