Clearwater IP Port Usage
========================

The nodes in Clearwater attempt talk to each other over IP. This
document lists the ports that are used by a deployment of Clearwater.

All nodes
---------

All nodes need to allow the following ICMP messages:

::

    Echo Request
    Echo Reply
    Destination Unreachable

They also need the following ports open to the world (``0.0.0.0/0``):

::

    TCP/22 for SSH access

If your deployment uses SNMP monitoring software
(`cacti <http://www.cacti.net/>`__ for example), each node will also
have to open appropriate ports for this service.

-  SNMP

   ::

       UDP/161-162

If your deployment uses our `automatic clustering and configuration
sharing <Automatic_Clustering_Config_Sharing.html>`__ feature, open the
following ports between every node

-  etcd

   ::

       TCP/2380
       TCP/4000

   For releases using a memcached store - that is all releases up to
   release 28 (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and from release 32
   (Pulp Fiction) onwards

   ::

They also need the following ports opened to the world:

-  HTTP interface (if including a Memento AS):

   ::

       TCP/443

Homestead
---------

The Homestead nodes need the following ports open to all the Sprout
nodes and the Ellis node:

-  RESTful interface:

   ::

       TCP/8888

They also need the following ports open to just the Ellis node:

-  RESTful interface:
