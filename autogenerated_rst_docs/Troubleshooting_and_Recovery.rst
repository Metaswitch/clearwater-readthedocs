Troubleshooting and Recovery
============================

This document describes how to troubleshoot some common problems, and
associated recovery strategies.

General
-------

-  Clearwater components are monitored by
   `monit <http://mmonit.com/monit/>`__ and should be restarted by it if
   the component fails or hangs. You can check that components are
   running by issuing ``monit status``. If components are not being
   monitored as expected, run ``monit monitor <component>`` to monitor
   it. To restart a component, we recommend using
   ``service <component> stop`` to stop the component, and allowing
   monit to automatically start the component again.

-  The `Clearwater diagnostics
   monitor <https://github.com/Metaswitch/clearwater-infrastructure/blob/master/clearwater-diags-monitor.md>`__
   detects crashes in native clearwater processes (Bono, Sprout and
   Homestead) and captures a diagnostics bundle containing a core file
   (among other useful information). A diagnostics bundle can also be
   created by running a command line script
   (``sudo /usr/share/clearwater/bin/gather_diags``).

-  By default each component logs to ``/var/log/<service>/``, at log
   level 2 (which only includes errors and very high level events). To
   see more detailed logs you can enable debug logging; details for how
   to do this for each component are below. Note that if you want to run
   stress through your deployment, you should revert the log levels back
   to the default level.

-  Changes to ``shared_config`` are detected each time
   ``upload_shared_config`` is run (see `Modifying Clearwater
   settings <Modifying_Clearwater_settings.html>`__), and logged to
   ``/var/log/syslog`` on the node from which the configuration was
   changed.

Ellis
-----

The most common problem from Ellis is it reporting "Failed to update
server". This can happen for several reasons.

-  If Ellis reports "Failed to update server" when allocating a new
   number (either after an explicit request or as part of creating a
   whole new account), check that ellis has free numbers to allocate.
   The `create\_numbers.py
   script <https://github.com/Metaswitch/ellis/blob/dev/docs/create-numbers.md>`__
   is safe to re-run, to ensure that numbers have been allocated.

-  Check the ``/var/log/ellis/ellis-*.log`` files. If these indicate
   that a timeout occurred communicating with Homer or Homestead-prov,
   check that the DNS entries for Homer and Homestead-prov exist and are
   configured correctly. If these are already correct, check Homer or
   Homestead-prov to see if they are behaving incorrectly.

-  To turn on debug logging for Ellis write ``log_level=5`` to
   ``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating it if it doesn't exist
   already), then restart Ellis (``sudo service ellis stop`` - it will
   be restarted by monit).

To examine Ellis' database, run ``mysql`` (as root), then type
``use ellis;`` to set the correct database. You can then issue standard
SQL queries on the users and numbers tables, e.g.
``SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '<email address>'``.

Homer and Homestead
-------------------

The most common problem on Homer and Homestead is failing to read or
write to the Cassandra database.

-  Check that Cassandra is running (``sudo monit status``). If not,
   check its ``/var/log/cassandra/*.log`` files.

-  Check that Cassandra is configured correctly. First access the
   command-line CQL interface by running ``cqlsh``.

   -  If you're on Homer, type ``use homer;`` to set the correct
      database and then ``describe tables;`` - this should report
      ``simservs``. If this is missing, recreate it by running
      ``/usr/share/clearwater/cassandra-schemas/homer.sh``.

   -  If you're on Homestead, there are 2 databases.
   -  Type ``use homestead_provisioning;`` to set the provisioning
      database and then ``describe tables;`` - this should report
      ``service_profiles``, ``public``, ``implicit_registration_sets``
      and ``private``.
   -  Type ``use homestead_cache;`` to set the cache database and then
      ``describe tables;`` as before - this should report ``impi``,
      ``impi_mapping`` and ``impu``.
   -  If any of these are missing, recreate them by running
      ``/usr/share/clearwater/cassandra-schemas/homestead_cache.sh`` and
      ``/usr/share/clearwater/cassandra-schemas/homestead_provisioning.sh``.

-  Check that Cassandra is clustered correctly (if running a multi-node
   system). ``nodetool status`` tells you which nodes are in the
   cluster, and how the keyspace is distributed among them.

-  If this doesn't help, Homer logs to ``/var/log/homer/homer-*.log``
   and Homestead logs to ``/var/log/homestead/homestead-*.log`` and
   ``/var/log/homestead-prov/homestead-*.log``. To turn on debug logging
   for Homer, Homestead or Homestead-prov write ``log_level=5`` to
   ``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating it if it doesn't exist
   already), then restart Homer/Homestead/Homestead-prov
   (``sudo service <homer|homestead|homestead-prov> stop`` - it will be
   restarted by monit).

To examine Homer or Homestead's database, run ``cqlsh`` and then type
``use homer;``, ``use homestead_provisioning;`` or
``use homestead_cache`` to set the correct database. You can then issue
CQL queries such as
``SELECT * FROM impi WHERE private_id = '<private user ID>'``.

Sprout
------

The most common problem on Sprout is lack of communication with other
nodes and processes, causing registration or calls to fail. Check that
Homer, Homestead and memcached are reachable and responding.

Sprout maintains registration state in a memcached cluster. It's a
little clunky to examine this data but you can get some basic
information out by running
``. /etc/clearwater/config ; telnet $local_ip 11211`` to connect to
memcached, issuing ``stats items``. This returns a list of entries of
the form ``STAT items:<slab ID>:...``. You can then query the keys in
each of the slabs with ``stats cachedump <slab ID> 0``.

Memcached logs to ``/var/log/memcached.log``. It logs very little by
default, but it is possible to make it more verbose by editing
``/etc/memcached_11211.conf``, uncommenting the ``-vv`` line, and then
restarting memcached.

To turn on debug logging for Sprout write ``log_level=5`` to
``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating it if it doesn't exist
already), then restart Sprout (``sudo service sprout stop`` - it will be
restarted by monit).

Sprout also uses `Chronos <https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos>`__ to
track registration, subscription and authorization timeouts. Chronos
logs to ``/var/log/chronos/chronos*``. Details of how to edit the
Chronos configuration are
`here <https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/blob/dev/doc/configuration.md>`__.

If you see Sprout dying/restarting with no apparent cause in
``/var/log/sprout/sprout*.txt``, check ``/var/log/monit.log`` and
``/var/log/syslog`` around that time - these can sometimes give clues as
to the cause.

Bono
----

The most common problem on Bono is lack of communication with Sprout.
Check that Sprout is reachable and responding.

To turn on debug logging for Bono write ``log_level=5`` to
``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating it if it doesn't exist
already), then restart Bono (``sudo service bono stop`` - it will be
restarted by monit).

If you see Bono dying/restarting with no apparent cause in
``/var/log/bono/bono*.txt``, check ``/var/log/monit.log`` and
``/var/log/syslog`` around that time - these can sometimes give clues as
to the cause.

Ralf
----

The most common problem on Ralf is lack of communication with a CCF.
Check that your CCF is reachable and responding (if you don't have a
CCF, you don't need a Ralf).

To turn on debug logging for Ralf write ``log_level=5`` to
``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating it if it doesn't exist
already), then restart Ralf (``sudo service ralf stop`` - it will be
restarted by monit).

Ralf also uses `Chronos <https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos>`__ to
track call timeouts. Chronos logs to ``/var/log/chronos/chronos*``.
Details of how to edit the Chronos configuration are
`here <https://github.com/Metaswitch/chronos/blob/dev/doc/configuration.md>`__.

If you see Ralf dying/restarting with no apparent cause in
``/var/log/ralf/ralf*.txt``, check ``/var/log/monit.log`` and
``/var/log/syslog`` around that time - these can sometimes give clues as
to the cause.

Deployment Management
---------------------

Clearwater comes with a system that `automate clustering and
configuration sharing <Automatic_Clustering_Config_Sharing.html>`__. If
you cannot scale your deployment up or down, or if configuration changes
are not being applied, this system may not be working.

-  The management system logs to ``/var/log/clearwater-etcd``,
   ``/var/log/clearwater-cluster-manager`` and
   ``/var/log/clearwater-config-manager``. To turn on debug logging
   write ``log_level=5`` to ``/etc/clearwater/user_settings`` (creating
   it if it doesn't exist already), then restart the etcd processes
   (``sudo service <clearwater-config-manager|clearwater-cluster-manager> stop``
   - they will be restarted by monit)
-  ``/usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-cluster-manager/scripts/check_cluster_state``
   will display information about the state of the various data-store
   clusters used by Clearwater.
-  ``sudo /usr/share/clearwater/clearwater-config-manager/scripts/check_config_sync``
   will display whether the node has learned shared configuration.
-  The following commands can be useful for inspecting the state of the
   underlying etcd cluster used by the management system:

   ::

       clearwater-etcdctl cluster-health
       clearwater-etcdctl member list
