All of the documentation and source code remains available for the community in GitHub.  Metaswitchâ€™s Clearwater Core product, built on Project Clearwater, remains an active and successful commercial offering.  Please contact clearwater@metaswitch.com for more information.

# clearwater-readthedocs

This is the source repository for http://clearwater.readthedocs.org.

We prefer to use Markdown, but ReadTheDocs works best with reStructuredText, so this repo includes scripts to convert our Markdown files into reStructuredText in the autogenerated_rst_docs directory (which ReadTheDocs will then use, because it contains the conf.py file). It also includes scripts to convert the mkdocs.yml table of contents into a Sphinx/rST table of contents.

This processing is done automatically by our Jenkins CI server - human editors should just change the .md files and the mkdocs.yml file.
