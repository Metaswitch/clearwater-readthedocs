# clearwater-readthedocs

This is the source repository for http://clearwater.readthedocs.org.

We prefer to use Markdown, but ReadTheDocs works best with reStructuredText, so this repo includes scripts to convert our Markdown files into reStructuredText in the autogenerated_rst_docs directory (which ReadTheDocs will then use, because it contains the conf.py file). It also includes scripts to convert the mkdocs.yml table of contents into a Sphinx/rST table of contents.

This processing is done automatically by our Jenkins CI server - human editors should just change the .md files and the mkdocs.yml file.
